					PaleoJojo's was a game where you played as a caveman trying to save his girlfriend who was tied up on the other side of a river. <br>
					You were supposed to throw <a href="https://crazybonespedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mookie">Mookies (Jojo's #4)</a> in the water to create a bridge. <br>
					The player was in competition against the computer, the first caveman to complete the bridge won.
